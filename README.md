# Hey there, internet wanderer!

## I'm Gruffyy 👋

Fullstack dev from Finland. Usually knee-deep in new tech — lately, that means getting hopelessly lost in the React Native maze 🐰. I'm into open source and Linux (because privacy matters... and because breaking your own system builds character).

These days, React Native is my main obsession. Some days it’s smooth sailing; other days, it’s like building IKEA furniture without instructions — except the leftover screws are mysterious libraries, and the manual is a Stack Overflow post from 2017.

I used to think Next.js auth docs were rough — but React Native’s ecosystem?  
> React Native + Expo + native modules like SQLite turns “JavaScript dev” into “DevOps intern” real quick. (No hard feelings. Or... maybe just a little.)
