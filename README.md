# Hey there, internet wanderer!

## I'm Gruffyy 👋

Fullstack dev from Finland. Always learning new things - currently trapped in the React Native maze 🐰. Open source and Linux fan (because privacy matters, and breaking things in the terminal is a hobby).

Lately, I’ve been knee-deep in React Native. It’s a bit like assembling IKEA furniture: sometimes everything fits perfectly, other times you’re just holding a mysterious extra piece and questioning your life choices. One day I’m building mobile apps like a pro, the next I’m in library dependency limbo.

I used to think Next.js auth docs were a puzzle, but React Native’s ecosystem? That’s a whole escape room. But hey, what’s coding without a little chaos and caffeine?

I’m also a privacy advocate - because let’s be real, big tech already knows enough about us. Let’s keep our data to ourselves, our code open, and our bug reports… well, hopefully not too public.
